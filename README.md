## Workflow Structure

### 1. Main Deployment Workflow
- **File**: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- **Trigger**: Manual dispatch with environment and release type selection
- **Jobs**:
  1. Deployment Lifecycle Validation
  2. Branch Validation
  3. Future or Active Release Check
  4. Deploy to Future Release

### 2. Promotion Workflow (with Approvals)
- **File**: `.github/workflows/promote-release.yml`
- **Trigger**: Manual dispatch to promote existing release
- **Jobs**:
  1. Validate Promotion Request
  2. **Approval Gate** (requires authorized reviewer)
  3. Pre-Promotion Checks
  4. Execute Promotion
  5. Post-Promotion Verification

### Modular Actions

#### 1. Deployment Lifecycle Validation
- **Path**: `.github/actions/deployment-lifecycle-validation/`
- **Purpose**: Validates deployment lifecycle requirements
- **Checks**:
  - Deployment timing/windows
  - Prerequisites completion
  - Previous deployment status

#### 2. Branch Validation
- **Path**: `.github/actions/branch-validation/`
- **Purpose**: Validates branch meets deployment requirements
- **Checks**:
  - Branch naming conventions
  - Environment-specific branch rules
  - Required approvals
  - CI/CD status

#### 3. Release Check
- **Path**: `.github/actions/release-check/`
- **Purpose**: Verifies future or active release availability
- **Checks**:
  - Release window availability
  - Release schedule validation
  - Release capacity

#### 4. Deploy to Release
- **Path**: `.github/actions/deploy-to-release/`
- **Purpose**: Executes the actual deployment
- **Actions**:
  - Deploys application
  - Runs post-deployment checks
  - Configures unlimited duration deployment

### Promotion Actions

#### 5. Promotion Validation
- **Path**: `.github/actions/promotion-validation/`
- **Purpose**: Validates if a release can be promoted
- **Checks**:
  - Valid promotion path (dev ‚Üí staging ‚Üí production)
  - Release exists in source environment
  - Minimum soak time met
  - No blocking issues

#### 6. Pre-Promotion Checks
- **Path**: `.github/actions/pre-promotion-checks/`
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive checks before promotion
- **Checks**:
  - Health in source environment
  - Test coverage and results
  - Security scans
  - Compliance requirements
  - Rollback plan availability
  - Target environment readiness
  - Dependencies verification

#### 7. Execute Promotion
- **Path**: `.github/actions/execute-promotion/`
- **Purpose**: Executes the actual promotion
- **Actions**:
  - Retrieves artifacts from source
  - Updates configuration for target
  - Deploys to target environment
  - Runs smoke tests

#### 8. Post-Promotion Verification
- **Path**: `.github/actions/post-promotion-verification/`
- **Purpose**: Verifies promotion success
- **Checks**:
  - Application health
  - Critical functionality
  - Performance metrics
  - Integration points
  - Error rates

## Usage

### Trigger Deployment Manually

1. Go to Actions tab in GitHub
2. Select "Deployment Workflow"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Select:
   - **Environment**: dev, staging, or production
   - **Release Type**: future or active
5. Click "Run workflow"

### Example: Production Deployment

```yaml
# Triggered manually with inputs:
environment: production
release_type: future
```

Requirements for production:
- Must be from `main`, `master`, or `release/*` branch
- Must pass lifecycle validation
- Must have valid future/active release

### Example: Development Deployment

```yaml
# Triggered manually with inputs:
environment: dev
release_type: active
```

More lenient requirements for development environment.

### Promote Release Between Environments

1. Go to Actions tab in GitHub
2. Select "Promote Release Between Environments"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Provide:
   - **Release ID**: ID of the release to promote (from source environment)
   - **Source Environment**: dev or staging
   - **Target Environment**: staging or production
5. Click "Run workflow"
6. **Wait for approval** from authorized reviewers
7. Promotion executes after approval

### Example: Staging to Production Promotion

```yaml
# Triggered manually with inputs:
release_id: release-20250103-120000
source_environment: staging
target_environment: production
```

**Approval Process**:
1. Promotion request is validated
2. Workflow pauses at approval gate
3. Authorized reviewers receive notification
4. Reviewers can approve/reject in GitHub UI
5. After approval, promotion proceeds automatically

**Valid Promotion Paths**:
- ‚úÖ dev ‚Üí staging
- ‚úÖ staging ‚Üí production
- ‚ùå dev ‚Üí production (must go through staging)
- ‚ùå Demotion (staging ‚Üí dev)

## Setting Up Approval Gates

To enable manual approvals for promotions:

### 1. Create GitHub Environments

In your repository settings, create these environments:

#### Environment: `promotion-approval-staging`
- **Reviewers**: Add team members who can approve staging promotions
- **Wait timer**: 0 minutes (optional)
- **Deployment branches**: All branches

#### Environment: `promotion-approval-production`
- **Reviewers**: Add senior team members/managers for production approvals
- **Required reviewers**: 2 (recommended for production)
- **Wait timer**: 0 minutes (or add delay if needed)
- **Deployment branches**: All branches

### 2. Configure Environment-Specific Settings

You can also add environment protection for the actual deployment environments:

#### Environment: `production`
- **Reviewers**: Production deployment approvers
- **Environment secrets**: Add production credentials
- **Environment variables**: Production-specific configs

#### Environment: `staging`
- **Environment secrets**: Staging credentials
- **Environment variables**: Staging configs

### 3. How Approvals Work

When a promotion workflow runs:

1. **Validation Stage**: Automatic checks run first
2. **Approval Pause**: Workflow pauses and notifies reviewers
3. **Review**: Reviewers see:
   - Release ID being promoted
   - Source and target environments
   - Who requested the promotion
   - Full workflow details
4. **Decision**: Reviewers can:
   - ‚úÖ Approve: Promotion continues
   - ‚ùå Reject: Workflow fails, promotion blocked
5. **Execution**: After approval, remaining steps run automatically

## Customization

Each action contains TODO comments indicating where to implement your specific logic:

### Deployment Lifecycle Validation
Edit `.github/actions/deployment-lifecycle-validation/action.yml`:
```bash
# Add your validation logic:
# - Check deployment windows
# - Verify prerequisites
# - Validate approval status
```

### Branch Validation
Edit `.github/actions/branch-validation/action.yml`:
```bash
# Customize branch rules per environment:
if [[ "${environment}" == "production" ]]; then
  # Add production-specific rules
fi
```

### Release Check
Edit `.github/actions/release-check/action.yml`:
```bash
# Integrate with your release management system:
# - API calls to release system
# - Release schedule validation
# - Capacity checks
```

### Deploy to Release
Edit `.github/actions/deploy-to-release/action.yml`:
```bash
# Add your deployment steps:
# - Kubernetes deployment
# - Cloud platform deployment
# - Database migrations
# - Smoke tests
```

## Failure Handling

The workflow implements proper failure handling as shown in the diagram:

1. **Lifecycle Validation Failure**: Workflow stops immediately
2. **Branch Validation Failure**: Workflow stops, previous job outputs preserved
3. **Release Check Failure**: Workflow stops, deployment is prevented

All failures are logged with clear error messages and visible in GitHub Actions UI.
